# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

# Background Context
#### This project is meant to be done by groups of two students. Each group of two should pair program for at least the mandatory part.

# Learning Objectives

#### At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General

#### At least four different sorting algorithms
#### What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
#### How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
#### What is a stable sorting algorithm
